#OPTION and RESULT

##option and result is important type in RustLangBoth these are so similar, but it is not a same.
so we have to switch the use depending on the case


##Option<T> types are enum type of Values that may not be retrieved
None is not value
Some(T) is got the something to value 
None is not a error

```rust
  pub enum Opton<T>{
    None,
    Some(T),
  }
 ```
